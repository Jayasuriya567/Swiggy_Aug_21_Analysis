I have Analyzed Swiggy August 2021 Data using Excel.

Analyzed Swiggy's data for August 2021, and here are the key insights:

Total Revenue: Impressive total revenue of 381,790.
Total Orders: A whopping 1,878 orders processed.
Unique Customers: Served 408 unique customers throughout the month.
Taking a closer look at the month, we observed some interesting trends. There was a surge in orders at the beginning, reaching its peak in the middle of the month, but towards the end, there was a gradual decline in orders.

When it comes to categories, "Rice & Noodles" stole the show as both the most ordered and revenue-generating category by 30.52% of the revenue. Surprisingly, "Starters" ranked second in terms of orders but fell to third place in revenue, contributing only 20.48% of the total revenue. To maximize profits, we could consider a 10% price increase for starters.

Lastly, a fascinating observation about order days: Sundays were the busiest, accounting for a substantial 25.06% of orders, while Saturdays saw the lowest order activity at just 16.62%.
